To Generate Qt Documentation:

qtdoc contains the main Qt Reference Documentation, which includes
overviews, Qt topics, and examples not specific to any Qt module.The
configuration files are located in qtdoc/doc/config and the articles in
qtdoc/doc/src. Note that QDoc is located in qtbase.

The instructions in this file assumes that the prerequisite binaries are
compiled and in the $PATH variable.

Prerequisites:
    * qtbase exists
    * "qmake" and "qdoc" compiled and installed
    * other Qt repositories exist as needed

The Qt Reference Documentation were written with links to the released modules
for Qt 5. If the modules and repositories do not exist, then the resulting HTML
files will contain broken links.

There are two ways to build the documentation. One way is to compile the
documentation using QDoc and the configuration file (qdocconf) file. The other
way is to use qmake by running "make docs".

Section 1 Building the qdocconf File

    This method is useful for building separate projects without any
    dependencies to other projects.

    To build using the qdocconf file, run the "qdoc" binary and pass the
    qdocconf file as a parameter. "qdoc" is found in qtbase repository. A
    mandatory "outputdir" must be specified.

        $> qdoc doc/config/qt-project.qdocconf -outputdir html

    Note that QDoc will delete the contents of the "html" output directory.

Section 2 Building using make

    QMake uses the QT_INSTALL_DOCS variable to determine where the documentation
    for Qt 5 are installed. This method is useful for linking to other Qt
    modules.

    To see where the documentation will be installed, run:
    $> qmake -query

    To generate the documentation, run:

    $> cd qtdoc  #or whichever repository's root
    $> qmake
    $> make docs

    "make docs" also works in the main Qt 5 repository. Running the command
    there will generate the documentation for Qt 5 and install them to the
    path set to the QT_INSTALL_DOCS variable.

Section 3 Packaging the Documentation

    To package the documentation for Qt Assistant, the HTML files must be
    compiled into a QCH file (.qch).

    Required binaries:
    * assistant - found in qttools
    * qhelpgenerator - found in qttools

    To compile thq qch file for each module, first enter the output directory
    which contains the .qhp file and generate the QCH file.

    $> cd qtbase/doc/qtdoc              #the default path for QT_INSTALL_DOCS for qtdoc
    $> qhelpgenerator qtdoc.qhp         #creates the QCH file called qtdoc.qch
    $> assistant -register qtdoc.qch    #to automatically load the documentation
