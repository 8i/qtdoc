\title Testing and debugging
\brief Writing unit tests and debugging with Qt

### Short top-level abstract about writing debuggable code which leads into the following
sections.

\section1 Writing unit tests with QtTest Module

### Short introduction to concept of unit tests and brief description of tools
providing support for this in Qt and QML.

\endlist

\section1 Debugging Qt applications

### Presenting APIs useful for debugging Qt applications, in C++ and QML. Mention stuff like
building with debug symbols, QDebug and Q_ASSERT, and environment variables that could help
with debugging: QT_DEBUG_PLUGINS and QML_IMPORT_TRACE.
