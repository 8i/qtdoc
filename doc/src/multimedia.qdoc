\title Multimedia
\brief Qt's multimedia features

\l{Qt Multimedia} is a new essential module replacing the QtMultimedia library and
Qt MultimediaKit mobility API in Qt 4.8. It features full support for Audio and
Video playback, and recording. Support for camera and radio makes it a
complete framework that can be used off the shelf on supported platforms.

The following topics provide more details about the module and and its APIs:

\list
\li \l {Qt Multimedia Overview}{Overview}
\li \l {Qt Multimedia QML API}{QML Support}
\li \l {Qt Multimedia QML Types}{QML Types}
\li \l {Qt Multimedia C++ Classes}{C++ Classes}
\li \l {QMultimedia}{QMultimedia Namespace}
\li \l {QMediaMetaData}{QMediaMetaData Namespace}
\li \l {Changes in Qt Multimedia}
\endlist

\section1 Backend/engine

The Qt Multimedia module uses the systemâ€™s native multimedia engine as a
backend, and does not come with its own audio or video codecs. This means the
list of supported codecs is equivalent to the ones supported by the underlying
OS. For details, refer to \l {Multimedia Backend Development}.

\section1 Supported Platforms

Qt Multimedia is supported on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X platforms. It
supports all media and codecs supported by these desktop platforms.

It uses DirectShow and WMF on Windows, AVFoundation on Mac OS x and
gstreamer on Linux.

\section1 Audio API
Qt Multimedia provides APIs to process variety of audio input formats including
the raw format. It also supports 3D positional audio. For more information,
refer to the following topics:
\list
\li \l {Positional Audio}
\li \l {Audio Overview}
\li \l {QAudio}{QAudio Namespcae}
\endlist

\section1 Video API
Qt Multimedia provides APIs to process the video formats and playback.
These basic features are also accessible using the C++ classes and the QML
types. Besides this, the module also provides low-level APIs to for complex
use cases such as accessing the individual video frames. For more details,
refer to the \l {Video Overview}.

\section1 Camera API
The camera support in Qt Multimedia enables you to access the camera hardware
to capture photos and record videos. It also supports post-processing the
photos and videos, before storing them locally. For more details, refer to the
\l {Camera Overview}.

\section1 Radio API
The module provides necessary APIs to access the radio tuner and handle RDS
data. It supports AM, FM, LM, SW, and FM2 bands. For more details about how
to use the APIs, refer to the \l {Radio Overview}.
