    \brief Lists the new features in Qt 5.10.

    \section1 New Features in Qt 5.10

    \section2 Qt GUI Module
    \list
        \li Added the cross-platform Vulkan enablers, QVulkanInstance, QWindow
            with type VulkanSurface, and QVulkanWindow. These enablers are for
            Windows, Linux (xcb), and Android (level 23+).
        \li Added new flags and functions to QSurfaceFormat and QOpenGLWidget,
            to request sRGB-capable default/backing framebuffers.
        \li Added the cross-platform enablers for OpenGL ES 3.2 API, which are
            now accessible through QOpenGLExtraFunctions.
        \li Added support for more than 2 Gigabyte of pixel data in QImage.
    \endlist

    \section2 Qt Widgets Module
    \list
        \li Added support for embedding a window into a QWidget on Android
            using \l{QWidget::createWindowContainer}().
        \li Added support for rendering and reading back (grabbing) offscreen
            content using QOpenGLWidget.
    \endlist

    \section2 Qt Quick Module
    \list
        \li Added a shapes plugin, providing a Shape type under
            QtQuick.Shapes 1.0, which enables adding stroked and filled paths
            into Qt Quick scenes. Such shapes are rendered either by generating
            geometry or by using the GL_NV_path_rendering extension.
        \li Added the Qt.labs.handlers plugin (tech. preview), providing
            TapHandler, PinchHandler, and DragHandler. These are lightweight
            objects for handling events from the mouse or the touchscreen in a
            device-agnostic way.
            \note The plugin is available as a technology preview so it could
            could change in future releases.
        \li Added support for multi-sample framebuffers to QQuickItem layers
            using the layer.samples property.
    \endlist

    \section2 Qt Graphical Effects Module
    \list
        \li Added support for effects in core profile OpenGL contexts.
    \endlist

    \section2 Qt WebEngine Module
    \list
        \li Updated to be based on Chromium 60.
        \li Added pause/resume functionality to download items.
        \li Added settings for blocking JavaScript focus and hiding scrollbars.
        \li Updated QWebEnginePage with more WebActions, which were supported
            by QWebPage earlier.
        \li Added QWebEnginePage::download for triggering downloads.
    \endlist

    \section2 Qt SerialBus Module
    \list
        \li Added local echo flag to QCanBusFrame to mark frames that are sent
            from the local system to the CAN bus.
    \endlist

    \section1 New Modules
    \list
        \li \l {Qt Network Authentication}Â - Provides support for OAuth1 and OAuth2.
        \li \l {Qt Speech} - Enables text-to-speech in Qt Applications.
     \endlist

    These modules were previously released as technology preview and are
    now fully supported Qt add-on modules.

    \section1 Technology Preview Modules
    \list
        \li \l {Qt Remote Objects} (TP2) - Sharing QObject interfaces (signals, slots,
